# debertav3-movie-sentiment
Welcome to the repository for my NLP Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews project! This project focuses on conducting sentiment analysis on the Rotten Tomatoes movie review dataset. Phrases are labeled on a scale of five values: negative, somewhat negative, neutral, somewhat positive, and positive. Challenges include sentence negation, sarcasm, terseness, and language ambiguity.

The code was executed in a Kaggle environment with a GPU P100. The running time was approximately a bit over 1 hour. Our Kaggle score results were 0.70276, measured by classification accuracy. Despite the difficulty of the competition, the DeBERTa-v3 base model performed relatively well in this sentiment analysis task.

Potential enhancements include fine-tuning the model, exploring ensemble methods, and implementing data augmentation techniques. Synthetic data with fake movie reviews could be added to balance out the classes, potentially improving performance across all sentiment categories.
